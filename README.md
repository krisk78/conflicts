# conflicts header-only library

This library provides a framework to handle conflicts between objects.

To implement it in your project, install the [overlay port conflicts](https://github.com/krisk78/overlay-ports/tree/61cd2b103ca91bc03d7903adcef837260e348dfc/conflicts) and use vcpkg. Set your path to overlay ports in vcpkg-configuration.json ("overlay-ports": [ "your_path_to_overlay_ports" ]).
